<summary>💡Tips for using huggingface-cli (network problem)</summary>

##### 1. Using HF-Mirror

If you encounter slow download speeds in China, you can try a mirror to speed up the download process. For example,

```shell
HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com huggingface-cli download tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V --local-dir ./ckpts
```

##### 2. Resume Download

`huggingface-cli` supports resuming downloads. If the download is interrupted, you can just rerun the download 
command to resume the download process.

Note: If an `No such file or directory: 'ckpts/.huggingface/.gitignore.lock'` like error occurs during the download 
process, you can ignore the error and rerun the download command.
